# Modules

Each module has its own structure.
When modules are connected the module with the largest structure is the central module.
All modules connected to the central module must be lighter than the central module.
All modules connected to those must be lighter as those and so forth.
This does not mean the the central module must be the largest. 
Different materials can be used to build a smaller but strong central module and large but light satellite modules.
