# Technology
Technology is organized in 8 sections:

* Resources (rare materials detection, mining and storage; trading)
* Power (energy, drives, ...blur and cover fields?)
* Study (computers, espionage, scanners, communication, ...)
* Defense (shields and other equipment to help survive)
* Construction (materials, armour... ; about the size and the strength)
* Population (farming, housing, leaders ...; about the capacity)
* Automation (about the speed or prod-points/worker, robotics, ...)
* Attack (beams, mass-catapults, rockets)

Each section has 5 levels. 1 tech on first level, 2 on second and so forth.


**Unknown**

Bridge (leaders require certain minimum size; makes a ship a ship)
Crew's Quarters (1 troop per component)
Barracks (1 troop per component on the ground)
Headquarters (where leaders live on planets)
Make asteroid belt or field into a rocky planet
Shuttle Ship (one way to get troops to the group or another ship?)
Plating (allows to add a plating in any available material to a module)
Star Gate
Orbital Dock (construction yard in orbit)

**Resources**

* 1 Farm
* 1 Cyber-nursery
* 2 Mine (1 for mineral races)
* 2 Litalium (material; lithium-aluminium alloy ultra-light "steel", has its limits in size (to soft) and is quite easily destroyed by weapons)
* 3 Hydroponic Farming (upgrade; only on planets with water)
* 3 Armoury (mass/missile add-on; ammunition storage)
* 3 Nicaron (material; a nickel-calcium "iron" alloy; a lighter and "elastic" "iron", equally strong, more expensive but not rare. allows large structures) 
* 4 
* 4 
* 4 Special Ammunition (mass add-on)
* 4 Tritanium (material; titanium based super strong alloy that is still lighter than iron based alloys while not rare in general hard(er) to come by and work with; allows really large structures, good resistance against damage)
* 5
* 5 
* 5 
* 5    
* 5 Irmond (material; iridium + carbon: Organometallic compound; super hard, strong, chemical and heat resistant but also heavy and rare material; allows larger but not too large structures - its to heavy for that)

* 2 
* 2 Fusion Core
* 3 Extractor
* 3 
* 3 Turbo-charger (beam add-on)

**Study**

* 1 Lab
* 2 Academy
* 2 Digital Computer
* 3 Crystal Computer (2 for mineral races)

* 4 Structural Analyzer
* 4
* 4
* 5 Quantum Computer
* 5 
* 5
* 5 
* 5 Self-destruct Mechanism (explosive)


**Defense**

* 2 Force Field
* 2 Particle Field
* 3 Antimatter Field
* 3 Deflector Field

**Construction**

* 0 Yard
* 1 Irozine (material; "standard" iron-zinc alloy "steel" used for space)
* 2 Impulse Drive
* 2 Uni-Frame
* 3 Wrap Drive
* 3 Magnetic Lock (allows modules to connect)
* 3 Workshop (allows building on ships, 1 worker per cell, not needed on surface or orbit)
* 4 
* 4 Gravitation Hook (allow to "pull"/connect a module without it being connected by a gate, allows "carriers" - the benefit is that there is no limit to the size or wight as the two are not actually connected)
