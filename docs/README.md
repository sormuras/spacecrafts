# Documentation

The documentation at this stage is about the process of creating the game.
It is a roughly organised set of ideas, thoughts and notes that should help 
to crate the game code.

Directories:

* `lore`: contains a somewhat organised collection of ideas that might make it
  into game or not
* `mechanics`: contains already revisited files describing game mechanics as
  planned
