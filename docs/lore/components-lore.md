# Components

Is what is build on grid cells.

## Ideas

A list of components that maybe should exist in the game.

* Bridge (leaders require certain minimum size; makes a ship a ship)
* Crew's Quarters (1 troop per component)
* Barracks (1 troop per component on the ground)
* Headquarters (where leaders live on planets)
* Shuttle Ship (one way to get troops to the group or another ship?)
* Star Gate
* Orbital Dock (construction yard in orbit)
* Farm
* Cyber-nursery
* Mine (1 for mineral races)
* Hydroponic Farming (upgrade; only on planets with water)
* Uni-Link
* Fuel cell
* Fusion Core
* Extractor
* Turbo-charger (beam add-on)
* Transporter
* Tractor-beam (beam*)
* Wrap Jammer

## Detailed Ideas

### Repair Station (Add-on)

Output is the structure it can repair per turn. Edges could be used to limit how
much of that potential repair can be applied to a component in direct contact. A
station could be unstaffed in non battle situations. Changing staff takes 1
round in which all moved staff does not have any effect.

Repair can also occur during a turn.

### Target Computer (Add-on)

Can increase change to hit (lower risk for miss). This gets more important when
trying to hit a particular component which increases chance to miss.

### Shield-Booster (Add-on)

Boosts the recovery of a shield at the costs of energy and space. This means
after being weakened by damage the shield gains more points at the end of the
turn. As usual with add-ons the possible boost is limited by the common edges.

The booster can also be used to overload a shield giving it more then 100%
strength. This is done preemtivly giving higher strength from next turn which
lowers down to 100% over several turns.

### Cloaking Field

A shield that does not protect from damage at all. The main reason to make it a
certain size is to have it cover the full ship. When cloaked the ship cannot
fire without revealing its position. Scanners can be used to reveal at least the
position of cloaked ships. The difficultiy is proportinal to the size of the
cloaked ship. The smaller the ship the harder it is for scanners to reveal them.

### Flesh Palace (Add-on)

A component to lift spirit on hellhole planets or stattions. This could be bars,
night clubs and alike where mind is numbed to enjoy pleasures of the flesh and
escape the grind of the everyday nightmare of "a workers life". These are
miners, mass production workers.

Flesh Palaces work as add-on to places that cause a need for them. While they
lift the spirits of the workers they undermine a healthy culture that is in
balance as their existence is just so they could create a counter-balance to the
inbalance of reality.

The effects also depends on the politics and culture as this controls what is
legal or illegal.

The existence of such components could also open other ways of plaing the game
as some sort of underworld lord controlling flesh palaces across the galaxy.
While they might not be able to build components themselves they might use
politics to suggest usage to counter low spirit and then have ways to take over
the control. Such events are independent of the components function as a
component but work as a source of income in the game as underworld lord similar
to jabba the hutt in star wars.

There could be a black market related to the actual activities of underworld
lords which offer rare materials.
