## Ideas

* Death-Ray: radiation beam

## Weapons vs Shields

Mods can be about the phase/frequency/kind of the beam and shields about how
flexible they are when it comes to these variations. This still means some
shields are not effective. This also means some beams don't affect hull or
components but life. Shield recovery becomes a more important factor in case
attack and defense of two fleets are roughly equal. Maybe even the weapon delay
can be dropped and initiative is a question of ship speed, but we have to be
careful to not have that become too important. One way is to mix it with
scanners and target computers. the magic wand system in Noita uses cast speed
and mana (recharge speed and pool size) are two major factors where the positive
side (faster cast) also has a connection to the negative side (run out of mana,
need to pause shooting)

## Components

### Laser (Energy-wave Weapons)

Electromagnetic beams. Beams of photons (note this includes lasers, masers,
xasers, gasers, etc.). This includes all wave-lengths of the visible and
invisible spectrum. It goes to assume that different races would end up with
slightly different techniques all of which essentially transport energy to the
target using a beam. But they might differ in color due to used waves.

"Weakest but first."

Affect:

shields protection: 100% plating protection: 100%

Pros:

* long range
* speed of light (hits "instantly" on battle distances)
* most robust weapon (not that complex technique)
* lower energy required than phasers
* damages multiple components
* can fire with 1-n component strength and consumption
* high accuracy (no modification to chance to miss)

Cons:

* EM-shields are 100% effective
* most plating is effective
* cannot fire through own shields

Mods:

* pulsed
* continuous
* battery

### Phaser/Particle Cannon/Neutron-Blaster

Beams of high-energy charged particles (such as protons). Most realistically is
a neutron beam. In contrast to lasers particle beams have mass. So their do not
travel with the speed of light but their damage is usually higher due to the
mass.

"Medium damage, medium range."

Affect:

shields protection: 50% plating protection: 100%

Pros:

* EM-shield only 50% effective
* higher damage than lasers
* medium range
* medium time until they hit the target
* damages multiple components
* can fire with 1-n component strength and consumption

Cons:

* plating is effective
* special plating is very effective (even some lighter materials)
* higher energy consumption
* complex technique
* cannot fire through own shields
* need rare materials
* medium accuracy (small modifier to chance to miss, about 5%)

Mods:

* pulsed
* continuous
* battery

### Coilgun/Railgun/Mass Drivers

Using electro-magnetic fields to shoot projectiles.

"Largest damage, fires slowest/last. Short range."

Affect:

shields protection: 0% plating protection: 100% (25% armor-piercing)

Pros:

* shields only guard 25% of damage, mainly by slowing down the projectiles
* lower energy consumption (in comparison with directed energy weapons)
* can fire through own EM-shields

Cons:

* short range
* longest time until they hit target
* shields reduce accuracy a little
* damages target component only (no "overkill")
* more fragile than waves
* can only fire 100%
* lower accuracy (due to limited speed; chance to miss increases about 10%)

Mods:

* battery
* Armor-piercing (than 25% damage is done to plating, 75% to structure)

### Prism Chamber (Add-on)

A focus component that can be attached to a beam weapon to enhance the damage
output. The benefit of a prism is that it is a passive component that does not
need energy. It is a way to pay a fixed costs in space and construction costs
for higher output. The amount of input that can be enhanced is proportional to
the edges it has with the firing weapon. So the component cells themselves only
provide the available enhancement points while the usable are determined by the
edges. Also rare crystals can shift the type of beam giving it a different
nature like turning a laser into a death ray. Which effect a prism has depends
on the specific crystals used which can be found in mines or in ancient tech.

The prism chamber could also be used to do shift phase of a crystal core to
increase its effect.

Also, a prism chamber can be used in connection with shields increasing their
output.

Since prisms are enhancers they should always give a bonus based on the enhanced
component so that the encanched component scales in relation to its base. This
makes sure that it does make a difference which base is used even when e.g. the
main effect seeked is the change of damage kind. A player can chose to not use
the prism on weapons to not switch the damange kind. This means a player can
also design a ship with multiple prisms attached to the same weapon chosing
which to apply but only one can be applied when firing.

Prism Chambers always require rare crystals. They can be build empty but need a
crystal to run which a player can equip when found.
