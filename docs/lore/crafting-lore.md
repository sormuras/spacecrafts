# Crafting

One of the main aspects of the game is to craft ships and cities. This is to
design a system.

## Ideas

A loose list of ideas for crafting in the game.

* "ancient tech" adapter: a component that allows to use found anchient tech -
  adapters cannot be researched but discovered - make this a leader thing where
  the leader gives extra high chance
* components require cooling/heating => effect on risks
* allow to "pull"/connect a module without it being connected by a gate,
  allows "carriers" - the benefit is that there is no limit to the size or wight
  as the two are not actually connected
* allows surface buildings on ships with special tech, 1 worker per cell, not
  needed on surface or orbit
* building for surface defense point + population protection (Bunker)
* organic forms need to research plating as it is not enough for them to have
  the obvious idea but they also need a way to grow it
* Make asteroid belt or field into a rocky planet
* Ships need deflector shields to guard against all kind of smaller mass flying
  around. Otherwise, they would constantly collide with those.
* captured components might be incompatible with the new owner - they need to be
  demolished
* need to track who build a component to be able to tell what players can use it
* "empty" slots (a frame) are a component that can be build into a ship (
  structure) in order to have the structure itself build something else later
  on. planets and orbits in that regard consist of kind of empty slots (the do
  not reduce costs). The frame reduces the building costs by 1. So the total
  cost does not change but the frame has to be build before the slots are filled
  what will delay the total time somehwat in most cases. Buildings that cost 1
  will not be free.
* materials are required to build modules at all.
* each module can be made from another material
* size limits are given through materials
* space stations can be build in orbits of gas giants
* colony independent space stations require a separate technology (extracting
  supplied from gas giants)
* components have a specific weight
* overload of energy weapons (up to 200% output if energy is available, can
  damage weapon) is an option during battle that has to researched
* overload properties of weapons are different (how likely it is that it will
  not be damaged)
* 100% plating is similar to structure sum. One can also chose a thinner
  plating. Maybe fix steps: 25-50-75-100% to allow some plating.
* maybe plating should not be allowed to exceed structure by a factor of 2 or
  something like that
* there should be a property of material or plating that is the limit of damage
  that can be absorbed. That means if the damage is to small it has no effect at
  all. The weapon simply is to weak to do something significant to the material.
  If the damage is larger the full damage is done as the weapon is effective.
  The limit is not subtracted from the damage in some way. This should provide
  an argument against many small weapons instead of few large ones. It could be
  as simple as using the materials structure as the limit. Maybe 1x for
  structure and 2x for plating. Simple and quite fitting values.
* energy buffers (add-on to for beam weapons to supercharge them, downside:
  energy is unused in turns before and bound for dedicated use)
