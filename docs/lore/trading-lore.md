# Trading Lore

## Ideas

* **black market**: fractions can ban resources (policies). This gives room for
  a black market of these resources acting a possibility for underground
  fractions to earn and grow. Reasons to ban a resource could be that it
  potentially has negative effects on the population when handled or consumed.
  Another reason could be counter measures against a resistance. If trading
  weapon base materials becomes illegal a resistance or underground fraction
  will have a harder time establishing an effective force in that area.
* **headhunters**: while they target people they are not used against leaders
  but npc characters which have a certain role.
