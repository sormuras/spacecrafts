# Materials

## Ideas

A loose list of ideas for materials in the game.

* Maybe even normal components should make a choice of material which then is
  linked to maximum spans/size possible to build?

## Candidates

List of materials that might exist in the game

* Irozine (material; "standard" iron-zinc alloy "steel" used for space)
* Litalium (material; lithium-aluminium alloy ultra-light "steel", has its
  limits in size (to soft) and is quite easily destroyed by weapons)
* Nicaron (material; a nickel-calcium "iron" alloy; a lighter and "elastic" "
  iron", equally strong, more expensive but not rare. allows large structures)
* Tritanium (material; titanium based super strong alloy that is still lighter
  than iron based alloys while not rare in general hard(er) to come by and work
  with; allows really large structures, good protection from damage)
* Irmond (material; iridium + carbon: Organometallic compound; super hard,
  strong, chemical and heat-resistant but also heavy and rare material; allows
  larger but not too large structures - its to heavy for that)
