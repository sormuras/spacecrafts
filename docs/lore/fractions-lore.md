# Fractions

### NPCs

Some fractions are always NPCs.

For example, the resistance is a non player fraction that always exists.

It does not actively develop but form from other fractions when those mismanage
or act cruel.

## Organisations / Power Structures

The form of organisation of a fraction is chosen as part of game configuration
and cannot be changed during the game.

* clans
* federation
* tribes
* collective
* resistance (NPC)
* corporations
* syndicate
* freebooters (pirates)
* trade union
* empire/kingdom

## Cultures

(need to group the below, so it makes sense)

* aggressive
* pacific
* virtuous
* curious
* diverse
* honourable
* negotiating
* creative
* ruthless
* artistic

## Life-forms

### Cellular/Biological

* flexible food using biosphere and farms
* flexible housing using biosphere and domes
* train troops
* naturally faster population growth
* only some planets are habitable (gaia, earth-like, ocean, tundra, rocky,
  desert)
* can integrate cellular and cybernetic races
* effected by low/high gravitation
* culture effects

### Robotic

* energy as "food"
* warehouse as "housing"
* build population  (in build queue)
* build troops
* stronger troops
* cannot be "creative"
* can only integrate robotic races
* not effected by low/high gravitation
* no need for most biological technologies
* population does not die on energy shortage
* limited access to (the benefits of) leaders
* no culture factor

### Cybernetic

* regen-bay as "housing"
* train troops
* slow population growth through cybernetic institute.
* no farms
* automation is characteristic tech branch
* slightly stronger troops
* can integrate cellular and cybernetic races
* less effected by low/high gravitation
* no (or minimal) culture factor

### Mineral

* train troops
* do not need "food"
* naturally slow population growth
* cannot life on ocean planets
* almost all planets are habitable
* grow buildings (no automation)
* can speed up building using rare materials
* energy transport is implicit (no gangways)
* ships cannot be captured
* higher demand in rare materials
* better finding rare materials
* can only integrate mineral races
* not effected by low/high gravitation
* cannot use multi-module ships
* reduced culture factor
