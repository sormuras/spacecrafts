# Discoveries

## Principles
Discovery mechanics reflect two principles:

1. The more related a problem is to the area just completed the easier it is to
   understand
2. The world gets more complex with the number of abstractions. With every
   abstraction and solution added it gets harder to add yet another one into a 
   coherent whole.

Possible discoveries are made in an _area of interest_.
This is the topic research effort is spent upon.
As the vague name suggests, there is no order to _area of interests_.
None is "better" or "more advanced". 
Instead, it is the interaction between them that makes the difference.
Therefore, the areas are not on a tree or line of progression but in a circle
divided into sections or fields.

Keeping research within the field or close to the field can make it easier to 
make a discovery. Jumping between unrelated areas on the other hand makes it 
harder to make discoveries.

## TODOs

* change the research fields/branches - it should include non tech-stuff like "
  spirit" or "nature"; "technology" is just one branch of research (so it should
  really be called "research tree or wheel")
* distinguish between things that are discovered and things that are developed?
  where something that we can think of possible solutions but we are looking for
  a "good enough" one is development whereas something we don't even know how it
  works is discovered.
* there should be attack and defense techs that operate on another plane then
  the material plane. For example: Mind-controling enemies ship to some degree
  => fun to find the action that messes with the design, hiding a ship from the
  material plane

* branch: charisma
