## Biosphere
Pros:

* robust (critical failure at 80% damage)
* provides housing and food
* lower relative construction costs than dome
* can be used on surface and within spaceships
* no effect on culture
* no effect on ecosystem

Cons:

* does not scale well


## Habitat Dome
A dome is a large scale habitat that provides everything needed to survive.
It becomes more efficient when scaled up.

Pros: 

* provides housing and food
* scales large
* better food/energy than biosphere > 28
* can be used on surface and within spaceships
* no effect on culture
* no effect on ecosystem

Cons:

* high construction costs
* sophisticated (critical failure at 40% damage)

## Hydroponic Farm
"Using technology to enhance natural processes"

Pros:

* needs less energy per unit of food than any other food source
* relatively cheap to build
* scales well 
* independent grid (critical failure at 60% damage)

Cons:

* does not provide housing
* can only be build on habitable planets
* negative effect on culture
* negative effect on ecosystem

## Food Forest
A arranged self-sustaining forest based on the ideas of permaculture.
"Letting nature take care of the problem."
Tree nurseries are used to create a growing ecosystem. 
The extend of the food forest is planed (as a component).
When the ecosystem grows to next level (like a population unit) the game determines which planed food forest cell becomes an actual food forest cell. 

Pros:

* no staff needed
* no energy needed
* fast to build (best/highest food per construction cost ratio)
* resilient (critical failure at 70% damage)
* fertile (high food per area/cell)
* positive culture

Cons:

* only possible on habitable planets
* no housing
* does not work on tiny scale
* requires more space (than e.g. hydroponic farm)
* needs time to grow
* needs healthy ecosystem to grow
* most likely needs support of tree nurseries


## Earthship
Ideal for colonizing habitable planets with minimal effort.
The special thing about the earthship is that is does not require and other system or building, 
is self-sustaining and produces small amounts of most things. 
A cheap alternative that makes life easy. 
Cover a planet with earthships and be done. 

Pros:

* only consumes as much energy as it produces (essentially no energy needed)
* Provides housing, food, production, knowledge, wisdom and culture
* cheap to build

Cons:

* does not scale (but does good en masse)

## Cybernetics Center
Cybernetic races have special needs in terms of food and reproduction that are taken care of by the cybernetics center. 

Pros:

* decentralised architecture (critical failure at 80% damage)

Cons:

* high energy consumption per unit of food
* does not scale well
* no housing provided


## Living Quarters
Simple quarters - mainly cheap (to build and run) housing.
Only available on surface for biological races.

Pros:

* does not need staff
* decent housing capacity
* low building cost
* low energy requirement
* decentralised architecture (critical failure at 80% damage)

Cons:

* no food provided (needs extra space)
* negative effect on culture
* negative effect on ecosystem


## Crew's Quarters
Quarters for the crew of a spacecraft.
Main purpose is to provide a space for troops.

Pros:

* 1 troop per cell
* low energy consumption housing
* no effect on culture
 
Cons:
 
* low housing capacity per cell


## Regeneration-bay
Only available "housing" for cybernetic races, one of their week spots.

Pros:

* no effect on culture
* no crew's quarters needed for troops.
* 1 troop per cell
* decentralised architecture (cluster failure at 80% breakdown)
* sophisticated technology (critical component failure at 40% damage)

Cons:

* scales poorly
* negative effect on ecosystem
* quite energy heavy housing


## Service Depot
Only available "housing" for robotic races, one of their week spots.

Pros:

* no effect on culture
* no crew's quarters needed for troops.
* 1 troop per cell
* no food needed for robotic races (can build more staff)
* decentralised architecture (cluster failure at 80% damage)
* agent technology (critical component failure at 70% damage)

Cons:

* does not scale at all
* negative effect on ecosystem
* energy heavy housing
