# Mercenary Mechanics

Mercenaries are an important concept to allow players playing an underground
leader to generate income by completing tasks. They also have benefits over
simply building a comparable fleet since their actions do not have diplomatic
consequences for the hiring fraction. This gives a way to play "dirty". But it
is not without its risks. MCs can fail to complete a mission. Their connection
to the buyer could also be uncovered by foreign agents.

## Ideas

* there are both NPC and fraction MUs. NPC really is just a fraction with no
  coherent goal.
* the longer a fleet is a mercenary unit the less it is likely to be known to be
  related with the origin fraction
* MUs take an ahead payment and a payment on completion of the task. They may
  very well fail to complete. Buyers can see their rate of completed and failed
  tasks to make a more informed decision
* the longer MUs stay MUs the harder it becomes to reintegrate them as usual
  fleet.
* MUs have a deal with their origin fraction and share a certain rate of their
  income with the fraction and keep the rest to themselves
* MUs need to pass a certain threshold of disconnection from their origin
  fraction to be able to go on missions against other fractions without them
  being seen as connected
* if a fraction can create MUs depends on their traits. for some fraction (like
  borg collective) MCs make no sense, so they can't create them.
* if a fraction can control MUs also depends on their traits.
* an MU either completes or fails a mission, then returns to become available.
  NPC MUs might just disappear.
* missions have a turn limit - if they are not completed by then they fail
* benefit of an MU is that they can get near a target, e.g. attack a unit and
  then escape whereas regular forces would be attacked by defences
* there is a limit on the size of an MU fleet and their ship size
* traits could control if player can pick missions for MUs

## Missions

* scout (a certain solar system)
* sabotage (a certain Unit)
* destroy (a certain Asset)
* espionage (get more knowledge about details)
